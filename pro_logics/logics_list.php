        <li>Write code to check a String is palindrome or not? </li>
Palindrome are those String whose reverse is equal to original.This can be done by using either StringBuffer reverse method or by technique demonstrated in the solution here.
<li>Write a method which will remove any given character from a String?</li>
hint : you can remove a given character from String by converting it into character array and then using substring method for removing them from output string.
<li>Print all permutation of String both iterative and Recursive way?
<li>Write a function to find out longest palindrome in a given string? </li>
<li>How to find first non repeated character of a given String? </li>
<li>How to count occurrence of a given character in a String?
  <li>How to check if two String are Anagram? </li>

<h3>Programming questions on Array</h3>
Array is one of the topics where most of programming questions is asked. There are many and many programming questions on Array and here I have included only some of them which is not very difficult to solve but some of array programming question can be extremely challenging, so well prepare this topic.
<li>In an array 1-100 numbers are stored, one number is missing how do you find it?</li>
<li>In an array 1-100 exactly one number is duplicate how do you find it? </li>
<li>In an array 1-100 multiple numbers are duplicates, how do you find it? </li>
One trick in this programming questions is by using HashMap or Hashtable , we can store number as key and its occurrence as value, if number is already present in Hashtable then increment its value or insert value as 1 and later on print all those numbers whose values are more than one.
<li>Given two arrays, 1,2,3,4,5 and 2,3,1,0,5 find which number is not present in the second array.</li>
Here is a quick tip to solve this programming question: put the elements of the second array in the Hashtable and for every element of the first array, check whether itâ€™s present in the hash or not, O/P all those elements from the first array that are not present in the hash table
<li>How do you find second highest number in an integer array? </li>
<li>How to find all pairs in array of integers whose sum is equal to given number? </li>
<li>How to remove duplicate elements from array in Java? </li>
<li>How to find largest and smallest number in array? </li>
<li>How to find top two maximum number in array? </li>
<h3>Programming Questions on Numbers</h3>
Most of the programming questions are based on numbers and these are the ones which most of us did on college level and mind you they still has value I have seen programmers with experience of 3 years struggle with these programming questions and doesn't solve it some time and take a lot of time which simply shows that they are not in programming in there day to day work.
<li>Write code to check whether a no is power of two or not? </li>
<li>Write a program to check whether a number is palindrome or not? </li>
Check out this post which shows how to reverse number in Java and can be used to find if its palindrome or not.
<li>Write code to check whether an integer is Armstrong number or not? </li>
Here is a Java program to find Armstrong number, you can use same logic to write code in any other programming language like C and C++.
<li>Write a program to find all prime number up to a given numbers? </li>
Here is another Java program to find prime numbers and print them. By using logic demonstrated in this program; you can write similar program in C and C++.
<li>Write function to compute Nth Fibonacci number? Both iterative and recursive? </li>
Check this Java program to print Fibonacci Series using recursion and iteration.
<li>How to check if a number is binary? </li>
For this question, you need to write a function which will accept an integer and return true if it contains only 0 and 1 e.g. if input is 123 then your function will return false, for 101 it should return true.
<li>How to reverse an integer in Java? </li>
<li>How to count number of set bits in given integer? </li>
<li>How to find sum of digits of a number using recursion? </li>
<li>How to swap two numbers without using temp variable? </li>
<li>How to find largest of three integers in Java? </li>
<li>Write a program to find prime factors of integer? </li>
<li>How to add two integer without using arithmetic operator? </li>
<h3>General Programming Interview Questions</h3>
In this category of programming questions I have put questions which are not fit into any data structure but presents a real life problem and you need to provide solution. These programming questions are sometime based on problems faced by developer itself. I have not included many Software design related programming question which I have shared on Top 20 software design questions and answers; you can also check that.
<li>Write code for Generate Random No in a range from min to max?</li>
<li>Design an algorithm to find the frequency of occurrence of a word in an article?</li>
<li>Write a program to implement blocking queue in Java?</li>
<li>Write a program for producer-consumer problem?
This article solves producer consumer problem using BlockingQueue in Java. You can refer it to answer this question.</li>
